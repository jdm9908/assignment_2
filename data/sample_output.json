  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper.",
    "Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder together in a large bowl.",
    "Mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined.",
    "Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot coffee, then whisk everything together. Batter is thin.",
    "Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
    "Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.",
    "Make the buttercream: Beat the butter on medium speed until creamy—about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute.",
    "Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.",
    "Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.",
    "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days."
