# Legal Analysis
- U.S. Copyright Law (17 U.S.C. ยง 107 - Fair Use): Scraping for research/analysis may be fair use if not redistributing copyrighted content.
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1030): Scraping public pages is generally legal, but avoid bypassing technical barriers.
- GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679): If scraping personal data, must comply with privacy and data minimization principles.

# Impact on Website Operations
- Minimal impact: Scraper uses respectful delays and retry limits to avoid overloading the site.
- Only public, non-authenticated pages are scraped.

# Privacy Considerations
- No personal user data is collected.
- Only publicly available recipe data is stored.
- Data is used for research/analysis, not for resale or marketing.

# Team's Ethical Framework
- Respect site terms of service and robots.txt.
- Minimize server load and avoid scraping sensitive or private content.
- Use data only for legitimate research and educational purposes.

# Alternative Approaches Considered
- Manual data collection (not scalable).
- API use (if available, preferred for compliance).
- Partnering with site owner for direct data access.
