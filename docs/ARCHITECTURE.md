## Technical Design Decisions

- **Modular Structure:** Scraper logic, validation, and transformation are separated for maintainability.
- **Exponential Backoff & Retry:** Scraper uses exponential backoff and retry limits for respectful scraping.
- **Validation Pipeline:** Data is validated before transformation and export.
- **Transformation Pipeline:** Adds value (e.g., total time, ingredient count, summary) to raw data.
- **Export:** Data is exported to JSON in `/data/sample_output.json`.
- **Error Handling:** All failures are logged and retried up to a limit.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new validators or transformers.
